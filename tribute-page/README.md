# Arrival, 2016, Denis Villeneuve - Tribute Page

Hello! 

This is the first project that will be included into my portfolio. I decided to make something personal, so why not based it on my favorite movie of all time? 

Arrival, 2016. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. Based on the short story "Story of your life" by Ted Chiang published in "Story of your life and others".

## Creating the tribute page

In this case I have used **SASS** as a preprocessor for the style of the site and plain HTML5. My goal was to practice the usage of different directories and files to define both variables, styles and responsiveness. 

## About me!

**This is part of /didac3141592's portfolio** and it is the result of the different exercices and projects I had to carry out during the Front-end Web Development course I'm enrolled in: _Singulars 2020 - Front-end Web Development_ by **PIMEC & Netmind & Barcelona Technology School**. 

You can check me out in my [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/didac3141592/).

Happy coding!
