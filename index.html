            <p class="plain-text">I am currently focusing on Front-end Web Development, hence, in this portfolio you will be able to see some of the sites (from newest to oldest) I have developed using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, Node.js... <span class="bold">In the footer of each site I specify exactly which technologies have been used to develop which.</span> </p>
            <p class="plain-text">Most of the older works you will see are the result of the mandatory projects I had to overtake during the 490h Front-end Web Development program I am taking right now - organised by <a href="https://www.pimec.org/es" target="_blank">PIMEC</a> (Petita i Mitjana Empresa de Catalunya) and <a href="https://www.netmind.es/" target="_blank">Barcelona School of Technology - Netmind</a>.</p>
            <p class="plain-text">However, you will also find some personal projects, some sites I developed with the idea of practicing a certain concept or technology, or some challenges that I completed following the guidelines of websites such as <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> or <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io" target="_blank">FrontEndMentor</a>; always giving them a personal minimalist and simple style.</p>

            <p class="plain-text first-p"> My name is Dídac Pérez Escrich and I am 23-year-old from Barcelona. After getting a B. Sc. in Physics (and a B.Sc. in Chemistry as well) I have decided to make a transition in my career to focus completely on the digital world. I believe that being present digitally is a matter of utmost importance nowadays - and it will be even greater in the near future. That is one of the reasons why I am deciding to invest in becoming a software developer.</p>
            <p class="plain-text">I also find my studies in the field of physics, or in science, a great complement to perform this task. Throughout the years I have gathered a rational point-of-view, a regime of critical thinking and the ability and problem-solving capabilities. Research, state of the art, being able to quickly adapt to new metholodogies also played an important part in my career at university.</p>
            <p class="plain-text">Besides, I focused my thesis in the theoretical spectrum, thus being <i>forced</i> to perform multiple simulations in order to gather an important amount of data which I had, then, to analyse. This has made me familiar with several programing languages such as C, C++, Python; with some of the most famous data-analysis and data-visualization software such as MatLab and Origin; and with Linux distributions. </p>
