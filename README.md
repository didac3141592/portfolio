# This is my first portfolio

Hello!

This is going to be my first portfolio as a front-end web developer - and it is also one of the responsive web design projects in FreeCodeCamp. That is the reason why it is made out of simple and plain HTML and CSS! My goal is to practice some of the concepts seen in the lessons such as flexbox and grid to create responsive sites.

## Creating the portfolio

In order to review my knowledge of such I have decided to use both in the development of the portfolio. Thus, I have used **flexbox** to create the navigation bar and **grid** to create the _What I've done_ section. That being said, I tried to build a simple and minimal yet easthetic page. I hope I have achieved it! 

Also, the images are logograms from the movie _Arrival_ (Denis Villeneuve, 2016). **Amazing movie, if you haven't watched it, go check it out!** 

## About me!

**This is /didac3141592's portfolio** and it is the result of the different exercices and projects I had to carry out during the Front-end Web Development course I'm enrolled in: _Singulars 2020 - Front-end Web Development_ by **PIMEC & Netmind & Barcelona Technology School**. 

You can check me out in my [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/didac3141592/).

Happy coding!
